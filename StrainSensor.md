For the strain sensor we use a full wheatstone bridge to allow for accuracy even during tempreture expansion and retraction of the aluminium.

This is the strain guage that I have been using and the type I will be selling with my kits it's important that the sensor looks like this as it allows for the most accurate sensor readings even when the aluminium is uniformly deforming.

In order to allow for easy install it is best to remove the motor fully from the board follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgWu_pFre-A&t=3s) if you require assistance with removing the motor.

The strain guage needs to be glued securely to the insider upper edge of the rail this is because as you step on the board the top of the rail will stetch and the bottom will compress. The sensors work much better when stretched so we tend to use the top to get the best readings.
Similarly the sensor needs to be glued as closely to the axel as possible to allow for the most significant deformation to be recorded.

To ensure a solid connection you need to clean the area thouroghly with acetone and isopropol alcohol. The next part is optional if there are clear machining marks on the rail then this isn't necessary but it may suitable to use a high grit sand paper to scuff the surface.
Now use a mildly thick super glue and place a drop in your cleaned area close to the axel. Clamp the sensor using a small platic clamp onto the super glue and let that dry for aproximatly 5 minutes.

IMPORTANT: the wires of the sensor should be running down the channel towards the controller box and the sensor should be on the side of the axel closest to the controller box.

Next use 2 part 5 minute epoxy and apply a thick layer over the sensor and sensor wires in the vicinity of the sensor itself. This will protect the sensor from water damage and other hazards.

Finally run the sensor cable into the cable shroud with the motor cable.
