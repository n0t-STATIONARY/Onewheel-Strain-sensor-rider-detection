The regular Onewheel footpad connector is used for both power and communication with the board these can be found online but I will also be stocking them in my store.
If you are wireing the sensor yourself there are some important factors that you need to keep in mind the two pins related to the foot sensors (1,2) must be posied together this can easily be done using solder. Pin 5 is the 5 volt power pin this is required to power the electronics. Pin 6 is ground and is also required for the electronics.

IMPORTANT: The foot sensor pins (1,2) are only able to be supplied a maximun of 3.3V so a potential divider is required to step the output of the arduino down from 5V to 3.3V this is easy to do but essential for the board to function!!!

if you have any worries about this aspect feel free to check out my store
